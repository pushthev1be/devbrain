# DevBrain - Developer Knowledge CLI

> An intelligent CLI tool for managing and accessing developer knowledge with AI-powered assistance.

## About

DevBrain is a comprehensive developer knowledge management system that combines a powerful CLI, a beautiful dashboard, and AI capabilities to help developers organize, search, and access development resources efficiently.it  the main problem it solves is idetiifying user patterns, errors, techniques, stack and recording all those events against future re occurence of bugs errors etc. it recognizes errors and comes up with matches it has from its database.

## Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Assistance** - Leverages Google Gemini API for intelligent knowledge management
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** - Beautiful web-based UI for browsing and managing knowledge
- 💾 **Local Storage** - Store and manage your development knowledge locally
- 🔧 **CLI Tools** - Command-line interface for quick access to knowledge
- 🎨 **ANSI Rendering** - Rich terminal output with color support
- 🚀 **PTY Support** - Full pseudo-terminal capabilities for interactive sessions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pushthev1be/devbrain.git
   cd devbrain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Add your Gemini API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
npm run dashboard:dev
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Running the CLI

```bash
npm run cli:dev
```

## Command Flow & Usage

DevBrain works as an interconnected system. Here's how to use it:

### Complete Setup (3 Terminals)

**Terminal 1: Start the Backend API Server**
```bash
npm run cli:dev -- server --port 3000
```
This starts the API server that stores and retrieves your analyzed code patterns and insights.

**Terminal 2: Start the Dashboard**
```bash
npm run dashboard:dev
```
Opens the web UI at `http://localhost:5173` where you can visualize your collected knowledge.

**Terminal 3: Run the Daemon (in your project)**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
devbrain daemon --path ./src
```
The daemon watches your code, analyzes files for patterns and potential issues, and stores data to the local knowledge base.

### CLI Commands Reference

#### `devbrain daemon [options]`
Watches a directory and analyzes code changes in real-time.
```bash
devbrain daemon --path ./src
# Monitors ./src directory for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python files
# Detects: patterns, code complexity, potential issues
# Stores insights to local SQLite database (~/.devbrain/brain.db)
```

#### `devbrain server [options]`
Starts the API backend that the dashboard connects to.
```bash
devbrain server --port 3000
# Exposes API endpoints:
# GET  /api/fixes    - All analyzed code insights
# POST /api/fixes    - Save new insights
# GET  /api/stats    - Statistics and metrics
```

#### `devbrain search <query>`
Search your knowledge base from the CLI.
```bash
devbrain search "loose-typing"
devbrain search "error-handling"
# Returns all matching insights from previous analyses
```

#### `devbrain run <command>`
Run a command and monitor it for errors/patterns.
```bash
devbrain run "npm test"
devbrain run "node src/app.ts"
# Executes command and tracks any errors/issues encountered
```

#### `devbrain stats`
View your brain's metrics and collected knowledge.
```bash
devbrain stats
# Shows:
# - Total blocks indexed
# - Time recovered (estimated)
# - Recall precision
# - Top patterns detected
```

#### `devbrain github <owner> <repo>`
Learn from a GitHub repository's commits and issues.
```bash
devbrain github torvalds linux
devbrain github facebook react
devbrain github pushthev1be devbrain --token $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Fetches:
# - Recent commits (up to 10)
# - Closed bug issues
# Stores as insights in knowledge base
# Use for: Learning from popular repos, analyzing error patterns across projects
```

### Workflow Example

```bash
# Step 1: Start backend services (in separate terminals)
npm run cli:dev -- server --port 3000
npm run dashboard:dev

# Step 2: In your project, start monitoring
cd ~/my-project
devbrain daemon --path ./src

# Step 3: Learn from GitHub
# Learn from popular repos to build knowledge
devbrain github facebook react
devbrain github google/go-github google go-github
devbrain github torvalds linux

# Step 4: Open dashboard
# Visit http://localhost:5173
# See real-time analysis in "0x02_BLOCKS" tab

# Step 5: Search your knowledge
devbrain search "error handling"          # Find error patterns
devbrain search "react"                   # Find React-related insights
devbrain stats                            # View collected metrics

# Step 6: Use in other projects (same database!)
cd ~/another-project
devbrain daemon --path ./src
# Dashboard automatically shows insights from all projects + GitHub data
```

### Knowledge Base

All insights are stored in a local SQLite database:
- **Location**: `~/.devbrain/brain.db`
- **Scope**: Shared across all projects on your machine
- **Data**: Code patterns, complexity, issues, metadata
- **Persistence**: Survives daemon restarts

The more you run the daemon, the smarter your DevBrain gets!

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dashboard:dev` - Start React dashboard (http://localhost:5173)
- `npm run cli:dev` - Run CLI in dev mode
- `npm run cli:build` - Build CLI for production
- `npm run core:build` - Build core package
- `npm run dev` - Start all dev servers
- `npm run build` - Build all packages

### Project Architecture

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following main packages:

- **core** - AI analysis, storage, database management
- **cli** - Command-line interface with daemon, server, search
- **dashboard** - React-based web UI for visualization
- **vscode-extension** - VS Code extension integration

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key (required for AI features)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub personal access token (optional, for accessing private repos and higher rate limits)
  - Get one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - Scopes needed: `public_repo` (minimum)
  - Used by: `devbrain github` command
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000 for API)

### Database

DevBrain uses SQLite for local storage. The database is automatically created at:
```
~/.devbrain/brain.db
```

Tables store:
- **fixes** - Code insights, patterns, complexity metrics
- **anti_patterns** - Common mistakes and better approaches
